Chapter 1 Exercises

P1.1
Write a program NamePrinter that displays your name inside a box on the console screen, like this:

    +----+
    |Dave|
    +----+


P1.2
Write a program that prints your name in large letters, such as:

    *   *    **    ****    ****   *   *
    *   *   *  *   *   *   *   *  *   *
    *****  *    *  ****    ****    * *
    *   *  ******  *   *   *   *    *
    *   *  *    *  *    *  *    *   *


P1.3
Write a program FacePrinter that prints a face, using text character, hopefully better looking than this one:

       //////
      | 0 0 |
     (|  ^  |)
      | [_] |
       -----
Use comments to indicate the statements that print the hair, ears, mouth, and so on.

  **My notes on exercise P1.3:
    I used some backslashes in my face construction and each one needs to be prefaced with an additional backslash as
    an escape character.
